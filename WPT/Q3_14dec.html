        <p>Twinkle, twinkle, little star,<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp How I wonder what you are! <br>
            Up above the world so high,<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Like a diamond in the sky.</p>

       <span>
        When the blazing sun is gone,<br>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When he nothing shines upon,<br>
        Then you show your little light,<br>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.

        Then the travâ€™ller in the dark,
            Thanks you for your tiny spark,
        He could not see which way to go,
            If you did not twinkle so.
